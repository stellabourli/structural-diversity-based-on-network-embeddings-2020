#### Abstract

Network embeddings have gained huge popularity in the recent years as a powerful tool to
analyze social networks. A commonly used metric in social network analysis is diversity.
Diversity of a node expresses how un-similar are the neighbors in the network. In this paper
we try to measure node diversity in a network using network embeddings. For this purpose
we suggest an embedded-based definition which measures node diversity. We perform a
number of extensive experimental measurements in 5 real-world and 2 synthetic networks.
We study the correlation between node diversity produced by our definition using
embeddings from different embedding methods. Moreover we search if exist any correlation
between diversities produced by our definition and other known network metrics. We find
that the most of the embedding methods are correlated between them, as well as that
diversities of our definition are correlated with some of the network metrics.
